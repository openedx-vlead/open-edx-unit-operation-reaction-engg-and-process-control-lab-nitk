<p><b>1.</b>Air at 1 atm and 20 degree C flows through a packed bed. The diameter of a sphere in the bed is 1 mm and the density <br />of it is 2.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The bed porosity is 0.4. The diameter of the bed 2.75m and the height is 2.75m.The viscosity of the air is1.81*10<sup>-5</sup>. Find the minimum fluidization velocity and the minimum fluidizaiton mass flow rate.<br /><br /> <b>2.</b>From literature , collect information on applications of fluidized bed in chemical engineering processes.</p>
