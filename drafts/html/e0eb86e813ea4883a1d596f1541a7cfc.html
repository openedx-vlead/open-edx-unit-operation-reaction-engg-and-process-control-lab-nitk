<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">When a liquid or a gas is passed at very low velocity up through a bed of solid particles, the particles do not move ,and the pressure drop is given by the Ergun equation. If the fluid velocity is steadily increased ,the pressure drop and the drag on individual particles increase,and eventually the particles start to move and become suspended in the fluid. The terms &ldquo;fluidization&rdquo; and &ldquo;fluidized bed&rdquo; are used to describe the condition of fully suspended particles,since the suspension behaves like a dense fluid.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">Fluidized beds are used extensively in the chemical process industries, particularly for the cracking of high-molecular-weight petroleum fractions.Such beds inherently possess excellent heat transfer and mixing characteristics.These are devices in which a large surface area of contact between a liquid and a gas ,or a solid and a gas or liquid is obtained for achieving rapid mass and heat transfer and for chemical reactions. The fluidized bed is one of the best known contacting methods used in the processing industry, for instance in oil refinery plants. Among its chief advantages are that the particles are well mixed leading to low temperature gradients, they are suitable for both small and large scale operations and they allow continuous processing. There are many well established operations that utilize this technology, including cracking and reforming of hydrocarbons, coal carbonization and gasification, ore roasting, Fisher-Tropsch synthesis, coking, aluminum production, melamine production, and coating preparations. Nowadays, you will find fluidized beds used in catalyst regeneration, solid-gas reactors, combustion of coal, roasting of ores, drying, and gas adsorption operations The application of fluidization is also well recognized in nuclear engineering as a unit operation for example, in uranium extraction, nuclear fuel fabrication, reprocessing of fuel and waste disposal.<br /><br /></div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">When a fluid is admitted at the bottom of a packed bed of solids at a low flow rate, it passes upward through bed without causing any particle motion. If the particles are quite small, flow in the channels between the particles will be laminar and the pressure drop across the bed will be proportional to the superficial velocity Vo and for turbulent situations, pressure drop across the bed increase nonlinearly with the increase in the superficial velocity. As the velocity is gradually increased, the pressure drop increases, but particles do not move and the bed height remains the same. At a certain velocity, the pressure drop across the bed counterbalances the force of gravity on the particles or the weight of the bed,and any other further increase in velocity causes the particles to move and the true fluidization begins. For a high enough fluid velocity, the friction force is large enough to lift the particles. This represents the onset of fluidization Once the bed is fluidized pressure drop across the bed remains constant,but the bed height continues to increase with increasing flow.<br /><br /></div>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap"><b>Minimum fluidization velocity:</b> To better understand fluidization of a particle bed, it is necessary to determine what range of flow rates allow fluidization, and also, what flow rates will begin to carry the particles out the top of the particle chamber. It is necessary to determine a minimum flow rate allowing the particles to become fluidized, the minimum fluidization velocity (Vmf). This is the minimum superficial fluid velocity required for the fluidization to occur. It can be obtained by setting the pressure drop across the bed equal to the weight of the bed per unit area of cross section,allowing for the buoyant force of the displaced fluid: <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2882%29.gif" /> <br /> At incipient fluidization , <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2876%29.gif" /> is the minimum void fraction <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2882%29.gif" /> Erguns equation for pressure drop in packed beds can be applied to the point of incipient fluidization and minimum fluidization velocity can be obtained by solving the resultant quadratic equation.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">The Ergun equation can be used to describe the drag exerted on a particle bed by the fluid flow.

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">The equations derived for minimum fluidization velocity apply to liquids as well as to gases, but beyond this velocity, the appearance of beds fluidized with liquids or gases is often quite different. Liquid fluidized beds usually exhibit &ldquo; particulate fluidization &ldquo; and the gas fluidized beds exhibit&rdquo; bubbling fluidization&rdquo;( Refer Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering by McCabe and Smith).</div>
