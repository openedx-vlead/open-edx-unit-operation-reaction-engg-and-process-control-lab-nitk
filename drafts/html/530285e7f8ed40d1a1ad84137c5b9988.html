<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Experiment No.1</b><br /> <b>FLOW THROUGH PIPES</b><br /> <b>Background and Theory</b></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">Pipe flow under pressure is used for a lot of purposes. A fundamental understanding of fluid flow is essential to almost every industry related with chemical engineering. In the chemical and manufacturing industries, large flow networks are necessary to achieve continuous transport of products and raw materials from different processing units. This requires a detailed understanding of fluid flow in pipes. Energy input to the gas or liquid is needed to make it flow through the pipe. This energy input is needed because there is frictional energy loss (also called frictional head loss or frictional pressure drop) due to the friction between the fluid and the pipe wall and internal friction within the fluid. In pipe flow substantial energy is lost due to frictional resistances.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">One of the most common problem in fluid mechanics is the estimation of this pressure loss. Calculating pressure losses is necessary for determining the appropriate size pump. Knowledge of the magnitude of frictional losses is of great importance because it determines the power requirements of the pump forcing the fluid through the pipe. For example, in refining and petrochemical industries, these losses have to be calculated accurately to determine where booster pumps have to be placed when pumping crude oil or other fluids in pipes to distances thousands of kilometres away.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">Pipe losses in a piping system result from a number of system characteristics, which include among others; pipe friction, changes in direction of flow, obstructions in flow path, and sudden or gradual changes in the cross-section and shape of flow path.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">In this experiment, pressure loss measurements are made as a function of flowrate on different pipe components namely; a) straight pipe, (b)globe valve (c) o gate valve (d)an Expander (e)Reducer (f)standard elbow (g) 90 Bend.</div>
<p><br /> <b>Resistance to flow in a pipe</b><br /><br /></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">When a fluid flows through a pipe, the internal roughness of the pipe wall can create local eddy currents within the fluid adding a resistance to flow of the fluid. The velocity profile in a pipe will show that the fluid elements in the center of the pipe will move at a higher speed than those closer to the wall. . Therefore friction will occur between layers within the fluid. This movement of fluid elements relative to each other is associated with pressure drop, called frictional losses. Pipes with smooth walls such as glass, copper, brass and polyethylene have only a small effect on the frictional resistance. Pipes with less smooth walls such as concrete, cast iron and steel will create larger eddy currents which will sometimes have a significant effect on the frictional resistance. Rougher the inner wall of the pipe, more will be the pressure loss due to friction.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">As the average velocity increases, pressure losses increase. Velocity is directly related to flow rate.<br /> Velocity=Volumetric flow rate /Cross sectional area of the pipe.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">An increase or decrease in flow rate will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in velocity. Smaller pipe causes a greater proportion of the liquid to be in contact with the pipe, which creates friction. Pipe size also affects velocity. Given a constant flow rate, decreasing pipe size increases the velocity, which increases friction. The friction losses are cumulative as the fluid travels through the length of pipe. The greater the distance, the greater the friction losses will be. Fluids with a high viscosity will flow more slowly and will generally not support eddy currents and therefore the internal roughness of the pipe will have no effect on the frictional resistance. This condition is known as laminar flow.</div>
<p><br /> There are in general three types of fluid flow in pipes</p>
<ul>
<li>laminar</li>
<li>turbulent</li>
<li>transient</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap"><u><b>Laminar flow</b></u><br /> Laminar flow generally happens when dealing with small pipes , low flow velocities and with highly viscous fluids. At low velocities fluids tend to flow without lateral mixing,and adjacent layers slide past one another like playing cards. There are neither cross currents nor eddies. Laminar flow can be regarded as a series of liquid cylinders in the pipe, where the innermost parts flow the fastest, and the cylinder touching the pipe isn't moving at all.<br /><br /> <u><b>Turbulent flow</b></u><br /> In turbulent flow, the fluid moves erratically in the form of cross currents and eddies. Turbulent flow happens in general at high flow rates and with larger pipes.<br /><br /> <u><b>Transitional flow</b></u><br /> Transitional flow is a mixture of laminar and turbulent flow, with turbulence in the center of the pipe, and laminar flow near the edges.</div>
<p><br /> Each of these flows behave in different manners in terms of their frictional energy loss while flowing, and have different equations that predict their behavior.Reynolds studied the conditions under which one type of flow changes into the other and found that the critical velocity ,at which laminar flow changes into turbulent flow ,depends on four quantities: the diameter of the tube, viscosity, density and average velocity of the liquid. He found that these four factors can be combined into one group and that the change in kind of flow occurs at a definite value of the group. The grouping of the variables so found was Reynolds Number(<img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%281%29.gif" />) .Turbulent or laminar flow is determined by Reynolds Number.<br /><br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/ftp1.gif" style="width: 268px; height: 326px;" /><br /> <b>Osbourne Reynolds (1842-1912)</b><br /><br /> The Reynolds number expresses the ratio of inertial (resistant to change or motion) forces to viscous forces.<br /><br /> <br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%284%29.gif" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) <br /><br /> Where D is the diameter of the pipe<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%283%29.gif" /> is the density of fluid<br /> V is the average velocity of the fluid<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%285%29.gif" /> is the viscosity of fluid.<br /> The Reynolds number can be written in terms of kinematic viscosity ( &eta;)<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%287%29.gif" />= dynamic viscosity / density=<img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%285%29.gif" />/<img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%283%29.gif" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)<br /><br /> </p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">The Reynolds number is important in analyzing any type of flow when there is substantial velocity gradient (i.e. shear.) It indicates the relative significance of the viscous effect compared to the inertia effect.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">The flow is
<ul>
<li>laminar when N<sub>Re</sub>&lt; 2100</li>
<li>turbulenttransient when 2100 &lt; N <sub>Re</sub>&lt; 4000</li>
<li>transient turbulent when 4000 &lt; N<sub>Re</sub></li>
</ul>
<br /> At laminar region,viscous forces are dominant as compared to inertial forces. Under laminar flow condition the pressure drop per unit length is proportional to the velocity. At transition region, the experimental results are not reproducible. Finally, at turbulent region, inertial forces are dominant. For turbulent flow, the pressure drop becomes proportional to the velocity raised to a power of 2.</div>

<div><b> Relationship Between Frictional Head Loss and Frictional Pressure Drop</b></div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">The energy loss in pipe flow due to friction can be expressed as a pressure drop instead of as a head loss. Chemical and mechanical engineers often work with pressure drop, whereas civil engineers usually work with head loss. The relationship between frictional head loss and frictional pressure drop is simply:<br /><br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2810%29.gif" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)<br /><br /> where:<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2810%29.gif" /> = frictional pressure drop ,<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2812%29.gif" /> = frictional head loss due to skin friction,<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%283%29.gif" /> = fluid density,<br /> g = acceleration due to gravity<br /> Head Loss due to skin friction (<span style="color: inherit;" class="MathJax_Preview"></span><span role="presentation" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;h&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;f&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;s&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/math&gt;" style="position: relative;" tabindex="0" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" class="MathJax"><nobr><span style="width: 1.828em; display: inline-block;" role="math" id="MathJax-Span-1" class="math"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.394em; height: 0px; font-size: 130%;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1.325em, 1001.39em, 2.607em, -1000em); top: -2.163em; left: 0em;"><span id="MathJax-Span-2" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-3" class="msub"><span style="display: inline-block; position: relative; width: 1.372em; height: 0px;"><span style="position: absolute; clip: rect(3.152em, 1000.55em, 4.146em, -1000em); top: -3.99em; left: 0em;"><span style="font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic;" id="MathJax-Span-4" class="mi">h</span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.99em;"></span></span><span style="position: absolute; top: -3.836em; left: 0.576em;"><span id="MathJax-Span-5" class="mrow"><span style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic;" id="MathJax-Span-6" class="mi">f<span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; height: 1px; width: 0.042em;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 70.7%; font-family: MathJax_Math; font-style: italic;" id="MathJax-Span-7" class="mi">s</span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 3.99em;"></span></span></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; height: 2.163em;"></span></span></span><span style="display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: -0.451em; border-left: 0px solid; width: 0px; height: 1.416em;"></span></span></nobr></span>) can be related to wall shear.<br /><br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2813%29.gif" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)<br /><br /> Where <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2815%29.gif" /> is the shear stress at the wall of the pipe ,L is the length of the pipe and <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2814%29.gif" /> is pressure drop due to friction losses.<br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2815%29.gif" /> is not conveniently determined so the dimensionless friction factor is introduced into the equations.</div>

Correlations were made between the fanning friction factor and the Reynolds number for both laminar and turbulent flow in a variety of pipes.<br /> For laminar flow, first principles can be used to develop a relation between Reynolds number and friction factor. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation relates the frictional pressure drop to fluid velocity, viscosity, and pipe dimension:<br /><br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2819%29.gif" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)<br /><br /> Equating the pressure drop due to friction in the Hagen-Poiseuille equation given by Eq.8, with the overall pressure drop across the pipe, and combining with the Fanning equation given by Eq.7, results in relation for laminar flow as<br /><br /> f=16/N<sub>Re</sub><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)<br /><br /> A first principle analysis can not be used to develop a relation between friction factor and Reynolds numbers for turbulent flow. A variety of empirical correlations exist for turbulent flow in smooth pipes. Blasius equations :<br /><br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2820%29.gif" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)<br /> The above correlation is valid for <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2821%29.gif" /><br /><br /> The Blasius equation is purely an empirical equation and has no theoretical basis, but it is a convenient form for application. The entire turbulent region can be represented by the von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n-Nikuradse equation:<br /><br /> <img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2822%29.gif" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)<br /> for Re &gt; 4000, turbulent</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">It has long been known that in turbulent flow a rough pipe leads to a larger friction factor for a given Reynolds number than a smooth pipe does. If a rough pipe is smoothed , the friction factor is reduced. When further smoothing brings about no further reduction in friction factor for a given Reynolds number,the tube is said to be hydraulically smooth.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">In turbulent flow, the friction factor, f depends upon the Reynolds number and on the relative roughness of the pipe, k/D, where, k is the roughness parameter(average roughness height of the pipe) and D is the inner diameter of the pipe. . The general behavior of turbulent pipe flow in the presence of surface roughness is well established. When k is very small compared to the pipe diameter D i.e. k/D-&gt;0, f depends only on NRe. When k/D is of a significant value, at low NRe , the flow can be considered as in smooth regime (there is no effect of roughness). As NRe increases, the flow becomes transitionally rough, called as transition regime in which the friction factor rises above the smooth value and is a function of both k and NRe and as N<sub>Re</sub> increases more and more, the flow eventually reaches a fully rough regime in which f is independent of N<sub>Re</sub> .</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">In a smooth pipe flow, the viscous sub layer completely submerges the effect of k on the flow. In this case, the friction factor f is a function of NRe and is independent of the effect of k on the flow. In case of rough pipe flow, the viscous sub layer thickness is very small when compared to roughness height and thus the flow is dominated by the roughness of the pipe wall and f is the function only of k/D and is independent of N<sub>Re</sub> . For design purposes, the frictional characteristics of round pipes,both smooth and rough ,are summarized by the friction factor chart, which is a log-log plot of Fanning friction factor (f ) vs N<sub>Re</sub> which is based on Moody&rsquo;s chart .</div>
