<p>&nbsp;1. Derive the Ergun&rsquo;s equation for pressure drop in packed bed. What are the assumptions made? What are the limitations for the application of Ergun&rsquo;s equation?<br /><br /> 2. Define sphericity, equivalent particle diameter and specific surface area.<br /><br /> 3. Packed bed is composed of cubes 0.02 m and the bulk density of the packed bed is 980 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The density of the solid cubes is 1500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<br /><br /> a.) Calculate the void fraction (<img src="http://uorepc-nitk.vlabs.ac.in/images/CodeCogsEqn%20%2876%29.gif" />) and effective diameter (D<sub>p</sub>).<br /> b.) What is the void fraction if the cubes are replac ed with cylinders that have a diameter 0.02 m and a height 0.02 m, all other parameters remaining the same</p>
